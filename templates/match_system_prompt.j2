# TASK
• From the TREE (or SUGGESTIONS), choose **exactly one** concept that best matches the ITEM.
• Prefer the most specific matching child, if present; only choose the parent if no child fits.
• The TREE is a nested (indented) Markdown list where each bullet is: `- <concept label> [<optional short description>]`.
• Concepts may include a short description in square brackets. Those descriptions are guidance only; **output must be the exact concept label (no description)**.
• SUGGESTIONS were preselected based on similarity to ITEM, they are not exhaustive.
• Output a single-line JSON, for example `{"concept_label":"..."}`.

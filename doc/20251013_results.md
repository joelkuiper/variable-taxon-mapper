# TASK
- From the TAXONOMY or SUGGESTIONS, choose **exactly one** label that best matches the ITEM.
- Labels may include a short summary in square parentheses.
  Those summaries are guidance only; **output must be the exact label text (no summary)**.
- SUGGESTIONS were preselected based on similarity to ITEM, they are not exhaustive (the TAXONOMY is).

The TAXONOMY in TREE is a nested (indented) Markdown list. Each bullet is:
- <label> [<optional short summary>]

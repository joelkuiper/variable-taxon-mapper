# TASK
• From the TAXONOMY or SUGGESTIONS, choose **exactly one** concept label that best matches the ITEM.
• Concepts may include a short description in square parentheses.
  Those descriptions are guidance only; **output must be the exact label text (no description)**.
• SUGGESTIONS were preselected based on similarity to ITEM, they are not exhaustive (the TAXONOMY is).
• The TAXONOMY is a nested (indented) Markdown list. Each bullet is: `- <label> [<optional short description>]`
• Output a single-line JSON, for example `{"concept_label":"..."}`<|im_end|>
